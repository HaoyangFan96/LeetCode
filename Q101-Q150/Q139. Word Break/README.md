### Problem  ["Word Break"](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/description/)

#### Knowledge Used:
1.  Dynamic Programming

#### Code
-   [DP in java](./DPSolution.java)

#### Complexity
-   Time: `O(n^2)` because of usage of nested for loop in DP solution
-   Space: `O(n)` because of usage of 1D array for DP

#### Idea:
1.  Simple problem that can be solved by Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming
2.  This problem can be also solved by `DFS + Memoization` (similar idea) or `BFS`

#### Mistakes I have made:
